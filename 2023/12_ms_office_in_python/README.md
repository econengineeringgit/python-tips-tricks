# MS Office in Python

##### Create, read, and manipulate Microsoft Office files in Python.

The scripts provided in this project demonstrate how to:

1. Write to a Word document.
2. Write to an Excel workbook.
3. Read from these Word and Excel files, and create a PowerPoint presentation to summarize their results.

## Libraries Used

* `python-docx`: A Python library for creating and updating Microsoft Word (.docx) files.
* `openpyxl`: A Python library to read/write Excel xlsx/xlsm/xltx/xltm files.
* `python-pptx`: Python library for creating and updating PowerPoint (.pptx) files.

## How to Run

You can run each script separately. Make sure to run the Word and Excel scripts before the PowerPoint script, as the latter relies on the output of the former two.
