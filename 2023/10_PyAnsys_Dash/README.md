# PyAnsys + Dash app

This is a simple example of how to use PyAnsys and Dash to create a web app that allows you to interactively view the results of a modal analysis.

See the [PyAnsys documentation](https://pyansys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.
See Dash documentation [here](https://dash.plotly.com/).

There will be more basic `dash` examples in the future.
