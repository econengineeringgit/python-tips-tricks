# Refactoring example

At this occasion we'll try out the "Live Share" extension of VS Code. This extension allows us to share our code with other people and work on it together.

## What is refactoring?

Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure. It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimizes the chances of introducing bugs. In essence when you refactor you are improving the design of the code after it has been written.
