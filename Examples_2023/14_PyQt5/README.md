# Create GUI in Python

## setup
You will need only one package: PyQt5
After that is installed, then you may download Qt Desginer, can be found [here](https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download)

After you created your own GUI you can turn it into an importable python file!<br>
For example in this folder:
> pyuic5 -o example.py example.ui

After that you can create your Qt app, shown in the main.py!
